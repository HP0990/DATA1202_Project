## 📝 Project Title
**Data Transformations using Python (Pandas) - Video Game Sales Dataset**

## 📌 Short Description
This Python project uses the 2016 Video Game Sales dataset to perform data transformations using Pandas. The main objective was to analyze how global sales changed before and after the year 2005. The script also involved cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and categorizing sales data based on time periods.
